    "description": "Events for abandoned orders.\n\nAn event will be emitted for every order that is abandoned. The abandoned time is defined by a string representing a UTC time in ISO 8601 format.\n\nAn order or a shopping cart can include multiple product types. These products are selected by the customer but never checked out.\n\nNote that abandoned shopping cart events may include PII information about customers, such as email addresses. You may wish to redact this information if using the stream of events for insecure purposes.\n\nProduct descriptions in the carts follow a consistent pattern: They always start with the material/colour description (e.g. Stonewashed or Black) followed by a product type (e.g. Bootcut or Straight-leg) and finish with the product name (e.g. Jeans). These are not available as separate fields, so you may wish to parse the description string to identify events for specific types or colours of jeans for example.",
